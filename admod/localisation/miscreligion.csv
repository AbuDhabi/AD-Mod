EVTNAME21020;End of Religious Turmoil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC21020;Philosophers and holy men throughout our country have convened in $CAPITAL$ to discuss all matters theological. Though the debate was heated on all sides, they have agreed that there needs to be an end to conflict. The human cost has already been far too great and outside powers are taking notice of our weakened state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA21020;Let there be peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME21021;The Pope is pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC21021;Our people in $PROVINCENAME$ are free to worship however they wish. It seems in this case that they wish to follow the example set by the state. Our advisors were skeptical of our tolerant policies but the people have found true wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME21050;Tolerance causing divide;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC21050;Our government's committal to religious tolerance is taking it's toll on the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The people there have decided to pursue the heretical beliefs of Jan Hus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA21050;We're all in this together;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME30200;Wife not producing heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30200;Despite considerable attention paid to your husbandly duties, your wife has failed to produce an heir suitable to the crown. Perhaps this is a sign that your marriage is blighted in the eyes of God. While you have made known your desire for a divorce the Pope has stated that he will not support this. A bishop of the state could perform the annulment but this would require a formal revocation of the Pope's power over our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME30300;Nanak Dev gathering disciples;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC30300;A man who has been strongly critical of both Hindu and Muslim teachings has been gathering followers in $PROVINCENAME$. He claims that we are all connected through the truth of one shapeless, eternal God. This is heresy against our official religion but the Punjabi people seem to be embracing these beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
