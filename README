This is the readme for Abu Dhabi's EU3 mod, which is based on Misc Mods (version 0.799 DW) by BrainMeats.

IMPORTANT: This is the final version of the mod. Due to the release of patch 5.2 to Divine Wind, this mod is being put on indefinite hold for lack of easy conversion. If MiscMods updates to 5.2, I'll get on to updating this mod again. Until that time, EU3 lovers!

Compatible EU3 version: Divine Wind 5.1

Installation:
Put the following files/directories in your P:/ath_to_EU3/mod/ directory.
* admod.mod
* admod

Make sure you have the latest Divine Wind patch installed!

Changes (from base Misc Mods):
* Theocracies and the Papacy do not require Unam Sanctam to purge heresy.
* Theocracies with Divine Supremacy or Unam Sanctam of any religion may wage holy war. The Papacy may wage holy war always, until the time runs out.
* Catholic.txt added to events folder. httt.csv added to localization folder. Kingdom of God now doesn't disable the Papacy, making the decision worth doing. 
* Heresy events that convert Shinto/Confucian/Buddhist into each other. No more Mongol Jews, please!
* National Conscripts given +15% reinforce speed, to make it suck less.
* Vetting given -20% stability cost, to make it actually pretty good.
* Halved maximum manpower. A better solution to it being a non-issue would be to significantly lower its regrowth, but I don't know how to mod that.
* All non-Christian, non-Muslim, non-Dharmic, non-Taoic provinces can convert to Christian or Muslim, as pagans do in vanilla.
* Added Elections.txt to events folder. Added in_nomine_text.csv to localisation folder. Changed elections to be less overpowered for selecting high-statted rulers. Now they're only a little better than monarchies.
* Cleansing of Heresy gets the normal bonus for annexation, as well as province demanding.
* Mercantilism now gives a bonus to production efficiency (10% for maximum).
* Offensive now penalizes fort defense less (-10% for maximum).
* Quantity now reduces land attrition (-25% for maximum).
* Decentralization now gives reduces revolt risk and stability cost (-3 and -25% respectively, at maximum).
* Land Tech and Naval Tech cost modifiers moved from Serfdom/Free Subjects to Land/Naval (kept the same amounts).
* Post Offices now increase Global Tariffs by 1%, as opposed to increasing Global Trade Income by 1%.
* Customs Houses now increase Trade Efficiency by 1% instead of increasing Global Tariffs by 1%.
* Stock Exchanges now increase Production Efficiency by 1%.
* Added Construction.txt to missions folder. Missions to construct Fine Arts Academies now fire only for provinces that produce Ivory, Gold or Chinaware.
* Updated colonial_takeover.txt to include Lowlanders.
* Changed Importation Act to penalize tech cost by 3%, rather than 6%. Changed Cultivation Act to penalize tech cost by 2%, rather than 6%.
* Added spies.txt to common folder. Added a spy mission to steal technology, available in the capital. If successful, it gives a +20 bonus to all research fields for a few years. If discovered, loss of prestige and some badboy.
* Added admod_agents.txt to decisions folder. It contains additional cultural decisions which allow the hiring of additional agents, for cultural tradition and money.
* Nerfed Unam Sanctam to give only 0.10 war exhaustion reduction, and given it instead +0.3 missionaries. Similarly, Revolution and Counter-Revolution now gives only 0.15 war exhaustion reduction. 
* Added a unification decision for the Roman Empire (with proper tag, flag and so on). Gives lots of cores everywhere.
* Added a unification decision for Japan, when the shogunate is disbanded. It is now possible, albeit slightly harder, to become one Japan.
* Changed sponsoring Fanatics, so that it doesn't matter if the target nation are heathens or heretics. In either case, you are supporting your own religion against others.
* Modified the modernization process: Now, modernizing again gives bonuses to technological advancement, even if your technological group is not Western and you cannot take advantage of the neighbour bonus. Resisting western influences now again has some negative effects. Western Arms Trade is superseded by this change.
* Sphere de-nerfed partially, and now gives 0.5 diplomatic skill per point.
* The Papal State will no longer have the event that makes them convert to their overlord's religion. The Pope is Catholic. Deal with it.
* Innovative now gives a bonus to tolerance of heathens and heretics, while giving penalties to the tolerance of one's own religion. Narrowminded does the reverse. 
* Ecumenism now gives +4% missionary chance. This is actually historical, and makes the idea a good thing to have temporarily.
* Added text.csv to localisation folder. Renamed 'Narrowminded' as 'Traditional' and 'Decentralization' as 'Federalism'.
* Moved Trade and Production technology modifiers over to Mercantilism vs. Free Trade. Added tax and production efficiency modifiers instead to Serfdom vs. Free Subjects.
* Made population size affect taxes in a province, as well as manpower (more so than it already does).
